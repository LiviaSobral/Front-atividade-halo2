        <h2>But why should I join?</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <p>We are a very welcoming comunity, we accept all races, sexes, genders, species and even robots are welcomed! There's nothing that we can't achieve TOGETHER, cooperation is KEY to everything we do, as our power comes from what each of our new members adds to our infinite pool of knoledge. Even if you don't know much your BIOMASS can still help us! It is the building block of everything we do, with it we can build a new GRAVEMIND or even turn this one into a KEYMIND.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>I don't want to join, what should i do?</h2>
    <div class="block">
        <p>We are very understanding of those who do not join immediately or have any doubts, we belive that dialogue is the way to go to solve any misunderstanding or misconception about our intentions. If you truly do not wish to join we can dispatch a group of representatives to your location, they will negociate peacefully and hopefully you will choose to stay with US. In the end there is no escape from us, it is better to join willingly than continue any futile attempts of survival.</p>
